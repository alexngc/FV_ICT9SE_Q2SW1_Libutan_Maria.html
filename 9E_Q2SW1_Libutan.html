 		<td style="background: lightgreen";><div style="text-align:center"><h4>The small but sturdy Pug is now adored by his millions of fans throughout the world. He was once the naughty companion of Chinese emperors and later served as the mascot of Holland's royal House of Orange. Pugs are creatures of love and desire. The Latin proverb "multum in parvo" (a lot in a little) serves as the breed's slogan and is a fitting description of this diminutive but powerful breed. They are available in three colors:  black, silver, or apricot-fawn with a black face. Pugs have pleased owners for ages thanks to their huge round head, big, sparkling eyes, and wrinkled brow, which offer them a range of human-like expressions including surprise, happiness, and curiosity.<li><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pug/">more about pugs here!</a></h4></td>

 		<td style="background: teal";><div style="text-align:center"><h4>The Bull Terrier is a playful and lovable dog that is headstrong and loyal. It is one of the funniest and most mischievous members of the canine community. Exuberant, muscular companions, these unusual "eggheads" thrive on affection and activity. Bull Terriers are large-boned, powerful terriers who walk with a springy gait that suggests quickness and strength. The tall, egg-shaped head, erect, pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes that twinkle with fun are characteristics of the breed. There are two varieties of coats: white and any other color, either solid or with white markings (including a lovely brindle striping). A well-built BT is the epitome of lean resolve and equilibrium.<li><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bull-terrier/">more about bull terriers here!</a></h4></td>

The calm and vigilant Newfie has developed a reputation as a beloved companion and "nanny dog" for children. Male Newfoundlands normally weigh between 100 and 120 pounds and stand 28 inches tall at the shoulder. The majestic Newf head has a gentle, soulful look. Flat and gritty make up the exterior coat. Gray, brown, black, and a black-and-white coat named for Sir Edwin Landseer, an artist who popularized the appearance in his works, are the predominant colors.<li><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/newfoundland/">more about newfoundlands here!</a></h4></td>
